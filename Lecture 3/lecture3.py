"""funtions and testing"""
# explain what a function is 
# define the key parts of a funtion
# call a function 
# design and write sample functions
# implement tests to debug functions by comparing expected vs. actual values

# two textbooks and exercises -- midterm exam

"""style"""
# Doc string on the top
# 2 blank lines before and after functions
# operators have a space on either side
# define a separate function to do each task, then have main() call it (makes debugging much more easily)
