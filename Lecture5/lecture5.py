"""Lecture5: String and Litst"""
# string's properties:
# immutable: the variable can be changed, but what it refers to, if that is immutable, cannot be changed.
# can make a new string, but cannot make some change to its exact element
# concatenation, * operator both create new string
# can use single quote, double quote or triple quotes
# [] index
# list can change its element, so it's mutable data type.
# list can hold any data types, including string, integer, float
# it can also have multiple data types as its element
# functions of string: read official documentation
# unicode, ASCII, chr(65), ord('A)
# mutable objects passed to a function can be modified by item assignment within the function
# when you want to change the tuple items, python will raise a TypeError
# 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
