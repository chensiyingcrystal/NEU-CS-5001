"""For loop"""
# 1. range function
# range object: range(first, stop, step)
# stop not inclusive; step can be -1
# 2. Iterating through a list
#list is mutable, so it can be changed in a for loop
# not all loops can be wrote as a for loop
#for example, something that you should validate user's input
#if user define l as a tuple, then it cannot be changed in a for loop
# 3. iteration wrap-up
# iteration works well on "linear" or "flat" data collections
# Recursion are more convenient for tree-like data structures
